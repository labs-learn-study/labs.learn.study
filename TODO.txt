x Fedora minimal server & basic Ansible with Monitoring & Virtualization
- OpenShift v4 KVM installation
- join forces with https://github.com/openshift/installer/pull/636 && https://github.com/openshift/installer/pull/1188 (https://github.com/dhellmann/ansible-openshift-libvirt)

- immediately install updates and reboot (in addition to dnf-automatic)
- faster secure-ssh - check files, to avoid unneccessary restart sshd
x install Python pre-reqs in a playbook (tested via sudo dnf remove python libselinux-python ; sudo dnf autoremove)
- How to correctly secure sudo but avoid requiring --become --ask-become-pass (see README) - ssh key on root?
- Ansible tasks replace with (or contrib to) Galaxy
- Nested Virtualization?  Easier to scratch completely than having to re-setup bare metal.

x write README
- find some colleagues
- fix a better name for this?

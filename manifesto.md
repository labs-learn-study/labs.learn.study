Linux and Open Source won.

Now we need to create The Open World Computer.

A World Wide Grid of independantly controlled federated compute & storage power.

Truly distributed, secure, privacy respecting, and entirely reliable because not centralized.

For learning and studying, any kid must be able to easily bootstrap a local Node within minutes.

An initial isolated environment must be able to run autonomously, entirely disconnected from a shared network.

It must be very easy to study and hack on the underlying Open Source code, and locally replace every part of the system.

Joining Nodes both increases capacity and creates redundancy for reliability.  Nodes can be joined in a Local Cluster, or by Peering through Federation with your Friends.

Capabilities offer Services from one Party to other Parties.  (The system will initially be free to explore in a lab environment, but Capabilities will eventually be billable in some form; in a competitive open market economy.  There will be plenty of space, and need, for corporations.)

While the basic building blocks for this are emerging, we're far from the destination of this vision.

There's lots to do.  It will be a journey.  It may span generations (thus EDU).

Let's get started.
